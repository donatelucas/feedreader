# FeedReader
1. Have a consistent UI and UX design.
  1. Many times when a software is made for projects, they don’t have an unified design. We want to deliver this feature as if it was a professional app, not some type of glued up broken thing that barely resembles software.
2. Have responsive design.
  1. A good fit for most screen types. Probably a good fit for 1x, 0.5x, and 0.25x, and maybe some other screen type.
3. Allow users to log-in.
  1. We might need a server to test this one (perhaps a Heroku testable one, or just a local testable database), but in case we can find a way to work this out with only local storage, and it’s safe, then perhaps we can focus on it.
4. Collect and display news from real sources.
  1. This is what feed readers do.
5. Allow users to choose which sources they want on their feed.
  1. This is also what feeders do. But hey, we want to mention it!
6. Display sources by showing a preview of the source (title, image, 250 characters of description).
7. Sort feed by most recently updated source.
  1. It’s a personal beef of this team that many media and social media outlets nowadays employ non-linear timelines, making you go hunting for things. We want to do it as we would like to use it.
8. Allow users to choose how to filter their feed.
  1. Maybe people want more filtering options, so we give to the people what they want.
9. Prior Inserted Search
  1. It’s a terminology that I came up with (Lucas). Many FeedReaders and Social Medias have search engines of their own. But hey, searching is annoying. I want those selected interests automatically searched for me, and displayed whenever I open my feed.
