# FeedReader
1. Have a consistent UI and UX design, across all interfaces
2. Have responsive design
    - Nowadays there a vast amount of devices differing in size and orientation, a responsive design will solve this problem by rendering the application correctly on a variety of devices
3. Allow users to log-in and save information
4. Ability to collect and display the newsfeeds from real sources
5. Display the selected list of user feeds according with the user preferences
6. Display sources by showing a preview of the source
    - Users should be able to get a _sneak peak_ of what they are going to be viewing, before they view it
7. Sort feed by most recently updated source by default
8. Allow users to choose how to filter their feed, but always use linear dates for it
9. Prior Inserted Searchâ„¢
    - Instead of giving the trouble to users on searching things by themselves, make the selection of their favorite topics, and return to them - in order of importance, and "freshness" - a list of those topics. What it intends to solve the most is the non-linearization of feeds while also giving the users a better return of content
