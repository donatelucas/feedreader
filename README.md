## Purpose

In the actual market, Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, alongside feed readers, have adopted the practice to use non-linear feeds. Their intention - seems to be - is to make users to spend a few more minutes through their apps making them consume more content, and subsequently, more adds.

We think that is the wrong way to go about it. You don't build roads with secondary intentions. You build roads to make transportation better, faster, and, safer. Making the user find exactly what they want in the best possible time is what makes good engineering, and also make users happy.
