## Purpose

In the actual market, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, alongside feed readers, have adopted the practice to use non-linear feeds. Their intention - seems to be - is to make users spend a few more minutes through their apps, making them consume more content, and subsequently, more ads.

We think that is the wrong way to go about it. You don't build roads with secondary intentions. You build roads to make transportation better, faster, and safer. Making the user find exactly what they want in the best possible time is what makes good engineering, and it also make users happy.

Some applications are non-linear, as stated earlier, and some are too linear. A problem with "too linear" feeds is how some content can become less relevant when the feed has a fast pace (it's updating quickly). Good content might appear at the bottom of the feed because they may be mislabeled as unimportant if it is based on how many clicks/views it has, and some sources might be more recent so it might push the good content further down the feed.

How do we distinguish which has more value? We don't want our app to follow a non-linear feed. We want our app to follow an improved linear structure.


## Tech

We used React Native to build our mobile app, and we used Android Studio to have access to an emulator.

## Getting Started

In order to run our app, you must have React Native installed on you device. To learn how to install React Native, you can view their instructions for installation on their website at https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.

After you have installed React Native, you must have access to an Android device, since we have so far developed it through Android studio, or you can run it through an Android emulator. You can install Android Studio through their website at https://developer.android.com/studio/install.

Once you have React Native and Android Studio installed, you can refer to the React Native installation instructions (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) so you can connect React Native to Android Studio if you want to run the app through their Android emulator.

This repository is our main repository for this app, but we have a demo of the project at https://github.com/donatelucas/feedreaderdemo.
